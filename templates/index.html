                  <p > <i><h4>What is lung cancer?</h4><br>
                   <p> Cancer causes changes in cells that are otherwise healthy. The cells grow too quickly, without dying off.</p>
                    
                   <p> Normal cells in the body usually die at a certain stage in their life cycle, thereby preventing a buildup of too many cells. In cancer, however, the cells continue to grow and multiply. As a result, tumors develop.</p>
                    
                   <p> The two main types of lung cancer are small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, depending on how they appear under a microscope. Non-small cell lung cancer is more common than small cell lung cancer.</p>
                    
                    <p>Anyone can develop lung cancer, but cigarette smoking and having exposure to smoke, inhaled chemicals, or other toxins can increase the risk.</p></i></p>

             <h2> Types</h2><br>
<p>The main types of lung cancer are non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. They differ in the size of cell, as seen under a microscope.</p>

<h3>Non-small cell lung cancer</h3><br>
Around 84% of lung cancer cases in the India. are non-small cell. There are three subtypes:

<ul><li>adenocarcinoma</li>
<li>squamous cell cancer</li>
<li>large cell carcinoma</li></ul>
<h3>Small cell lung cancer</h3><br>
<p>Around 13% of lung cancer cases in the U.S. are small cell. This type tends to grow more quickly than non-small cell lung cancer.</p><br>

        <p><h2>Symptoms and signs</h2><br>
         <p> People with lung cancer may not have any symptoms until a later stage. If symptoms do appear, they can resemble those of a respiratory infection.</p>
          
         <p> Some possible symptomsTrusted Source include:</p>
          
         <ul><li> changes to a person’s voice, such as hoarseness</li>
         <li> frequent chest infections, such as bronchitis or pneumonia</li>
          <li>swelling in the lymph nodes in the middle of the chest</li>
         <li> a lingering cough that may start to get worse</li>
         <li> shortness of breath and wheezing</li></ul><br>
          <p>In time, a person may also experience more severe symptoms, such as:</p>
          
         <ul><li> severe chest pain</li>
          
          <li>bone pain and bone fractures</li>
         <li> headaches</li>
          <li>coughing up blood</li>
         <li> blood clots</li>
         <li>appetite loss and weight loss</li>

  <h2>Stages</h2><br>
<p>The staging of cancer describes how far it has spread through the body and how severe it is. Staging helps healthcare professionals and individuals decide on a suitable course of treatment.</p>

<p>The most basic form of staging is as follows:</p>

<ul><li>localized, wherein the cancer is within a limited area</li>
  <li>regional, wherein the cancer has spread to nearby tissues or lymph nodes</li>
  <li>distant, wherein the cancer has spread to other parts of the body</li></ul>
  <p>Similar to this is the TNM staging system. Healthcare professionals assess the tumor for size and spread, whether or not it affects the lymph nodes, and whether or not it has spread elsewhere.</p>

<p>There are also specific ways of staging non-small cell and small cell lung cancer.</p>

<p>Learn more about the stages of lung cancer here.</p><br>

<h3>Stages of non-small cell lung cancer</h3><br>
<p>professionals typically use tumor size and spread to describe the stages of non-small cell lung cancer, as follows:</p>

<p><b>Occult, or hidden</b>: The cancer does not show up on imaging scans, but cancerous cells might appear in the phlegm or mucus.</p>
<p><b>Stage 0: </b>There are abnormal cells only in the top layers of cells lining the airways.</p>
<p><b>Stage 1: </b>A tumor is present in the lung, but it is 4 centimeters (cm) or under and has not spread to other parts of the body.</p>
<p><b>Stage 2:</b> The tumor is 7 cm or under and might have spread to nearby tissues and lymph nodes.</p>
<p><b>Stage 3:</b> The cancer has spread to lymph nodes and reached other parts of the lung and surrounding area.</p>
<p><b>Stage 4:</b> The cancer has spread to distant body parts, such as the bones or brain.</p><br>
<h3>Stages of small cell lung cancer</h3><br>
<p></p>Small cell lung cancer has its own categories. The stages are known as limited and extensive, and they refer to whether the cancer has spread within or outside the lungs.</p>

<p>In the limited stage, the cancer affects only one side of the chest, though it might already be present in some surrounding lymph nodes.</p>

<p>Around one-third of people with this type find out that they have cancer when it is in the limited stage. Healthcare professionals can treat it with radiation therapy as a single area.</p>

<p>In the extensive stage, the cancer has spread beyond the one side of the chest. It may affect the other lung or other parts of the body.</p>

<p>Around two-thirds of people with small cell lung cancer find out that they have it when it is already in the extensive stage.</p>

        <p ><h2>Diagnosis</h2><br>
          <p>If a person has any symptoms that could indicate lung cancer or if screening shows something unusual, a healthcare professional will likely recommend some diagnostic tests.</p>
          
          <h3>Imaging tests</h3><br>
        <p> An X-ray, CT, MRI, or PET scan might reveal areas of lung tissue with cancer.</p>
          
      <p> If the cancer has spread, imaging tests can also reveal changes to bones and other organs. Scans can also help track the progress of treatment.</p>
          
    <h3>Tissue sampling</h3><br>
         <p> A healthcare professional may wish to take a biopsy to check for cancer cells. They will do this using a fine needle or a bronchoscope.</p>
          
        <p> A bronchoscope is a thin, lighted scope with a camera on the end that enters the lungs through the mouth or nose. A healthcare professional can use it to look for lesions and take samples.</p>
          
      <p>For less accessible lesions, they may use a more invasive surgical procedure, such as thoracoscopy or video-assisted thoracic surgery, to remove lung tissue.</p>
          
        <h3> Other samples</h3><br>
      <p> Laboratory tests can also reveal whether or not cancer is present in the:</p>
          
         <ul><li> pleural effusion, which is the fluid that collects around the lungs</li>
         <li> sputum</li>
        <li> blood</li></ul>
        <p>This information can help confirm if cancer is present and, if it is, determine its type and stage.</p>

         <h2> Treatment</h2><br>
<p>Treatment will depend on various factors, including:</p>

<ul><li>the type of cancer</li>
<li>the location and stage</li>
<li>the person’s overall health</li>
<li>their individual preferences</li></ul>
<p>All the treatment options can have adverse effects. A person should speak with their healthcare professional about the most suitable choice for them, including the pros and cons of each option.</p>
<br>
<p>Some treatment options include:</p>

<ul><li>surgery to remove part or all of a lung</li>
<li>chemotherapy, which refers to a drug treatment that can kill cancer cells and shrink tumors</li>
<li>radiation therapy, which uses high energy rays to kill cancerous cells</li>
<li>radiofrequency ablation, wherein a healthcare professional inserts a thin needle and uses an electric current to destroy cancer cells</li>
<li>targeted therapy, which targets a specific behavior to prevent tumor growth</li>
<li>immunotherapy, which helps the body fight cancer cells</li>
<li>palliative therapy, including pain relief, oxygen therapy, and other help that a person may need to manage their symptoms</li></ul>
<p>A healthcare professional will work with the individual and adjust their treatment plan as their needs change.</p>
